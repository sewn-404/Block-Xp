XP Mining: Tiered XP Drops

Enhance your mining experience with "XP Mining," a Fabric mod designed to add a strategic layer to gathering resources. This mod introduces a chance-based system for earning experience points (XP) directly from breaking blocks.

Key Features:

Vanilla Block Compatibility: Only grants XP when you break blocks native to Minecraft (e.g., stone, ores, dirt).

Pickaxe Requirement: XP is exclusively awarded when blocks are broken using any type of pickaxe (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, netherite).

Dynamic Chance System: XP drops are not guaranteed! Each block broken has a randomized chance to yield XP.

Tiered Rewards: The probability of receiving XP is directly influenced by the material of your pickaxe. Higher-tier pickaxes provide a greater chance for an XP drop, encouraging progression and rewarding tool upgrades.

This mod offers a balanced way to gain experience through regular gameplay, making your mining expeditions more engaging and providing a consistent sense of progress.
